      <description>1. What are you still learning and grappling with about yourself and how you tend to approach issues of reconciliation? The mid-year workshop brought to light how packed the concept of reconciliation really is. I always viewed it strictly on a societal level and only recently discovered the deeper personal associations that the term allows. Living in a space and attending a university where privilege is thrown in my face often, has really forced me to step back and take stock of the people I surround myself with and more so, the situations I find myself in.</description>

      <description>1. What are you still learning and grappling with about yourself and how you tend to approach issues of reconciliation? I always begin any conversation around reconciliation by providing creating a foundation for discussion. In this context, I hold reconciliation- or the idea of it- as an end, not a means to an end. As a result, when it comes to matters of reconciliation, the first lens I use is racial given our historic past as a country and the loss of dignity as a people.</description>

      <description>1. What are you still learning and grappling with about yourself and how you tend to approach issues of reconciliation? The ability to view reconciliation as a singular, subjective journey for all. There is a temptation to except everyone to view reconciliation in the same way e.g. repatriations for past wrongs, or recognition of privilege or even just having the same conversations surrounding the need for reconciliation. Sometimes, we expect too much from people – to see what we see or think how we think.</description>

      <description>1. What are you still learning and grappling with about yourself and how you tend to approach issues of reconciliation? A major thing that I am still getting to grips with is understanding both sides of the issue&amp;rsquo;s enormity. I think a place to start here would be to wrestle with what does it mean to do wrong to someone? What is the aetiology of the thing needing reconciliation? In some cases it’s almost like a festering disease that just won’t go away.</description>
