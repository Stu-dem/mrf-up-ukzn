We are a group of scholars from two universities in South Africa, [The University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/) and the [University of KwaZulu-Natal](https://www.ukzn.ac.za/) who have been selected as [Mandela Rhodes Scholars](http://mandelarhodes.org/) for 2018. This has been way more than a scholarship opportunity. We have developed strong friendships, been exposed to new people, ideas, and thought processes, and challenged to our core on issues surrounding leadership, reconcilliation, entrepreneurship and education.
